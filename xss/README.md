XSS
===

[ColonelPanic Dropper](http://colonelpanic.host-ed.me/) can be used as a drop point for using XSS injections.

One could probably send info through the dropper such as the `document.cookie` and look at it at the dropped txt file later on.

BTW, [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet) has many filter evasion techniques
