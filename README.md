Team Colonel Panic Tools
========================

Herein lie the tools that Team Colonel Panic uses/should be using frequently (but don't come pre-installed).

Another cool repo to look into is by zardus at [zardus/ctf-tools](https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools/). It also includes installers for all tools and is actually quite awesome.
