Debugging
=========

It is quite painful to have differing values of addresses when debugging and when outside. To fix this, there is [fixenv by hellman](https://github.com/hellman/fixenv).

Visualize heap operations with [villoc](https://github.com/wapiflapi/villoc).

Debug nicely using [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda) or [pwndbg](https://github.com/zachriggle/pwndbg).
